# OpenRMS

Open Restaurant Management Software (OpenRMS) is just that, a Restaurant Management Platform that is designed to be run on just about any system. Built using the [MERN](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-mern-stack) stack, it uses APIs to communicate to the front and back end and allows for the management of multiple Restaurants and Employees with many features planned for development. Future features include but are not limited to a Kitchen Display System and a [Point-of-Sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale) system to streamline everything using one product without having to rely on different vendors.

## Installation
OpenRMS uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a backend and [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the frontend. 

Navigate to the ``./server`` directory and run ``npm init`` then in the ``./client`` directory using ``yarn init``.

The server is run using ``nodemon`` in order for continuous development and the client is run by calling ``yarn start``.
